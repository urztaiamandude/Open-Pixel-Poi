# Notes about the config.h and app overrides

The [config.h](/Firmware/open_pixel_poi_firmware_platformio/src/config.h) file
contains all the constant perameters for the firmware. Most of these should
never be changed, unless you are building custom hardware.

Some of the fields however can be changed via the app, such as renaming your
device, changing the LED quantity or type, or even changing your 6 speed
options.

To enter to enter the device settings page, long press the app name on the
patterns page.

Settings changed via the app will permanently overwrite the default config.h,
unless a full chip erase is done. My firmware flashing webpage does a full
erase. The default upload button in PlatformIO does not.

To get a fully custom config, simply change what you need, recompile, and
upload.
