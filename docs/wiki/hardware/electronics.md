# Kicad project
This project was designed using Kicad, and is intended for jlcpcb smt
assembly. If you would like to purchase a PCB, visit the store link in the
[Readme](/README.md)

If you want to build this without a custom PCB, you can build the
[old version](https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/tree/v2.0.0/Hardware)
Just add an undocumented pull up resistor to the button.
