# Open Pixel Poi - 3D Printed Extras

## Caps
Little hats for your poi! Annoying to put on, but they look great!
1. **Option 1:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell Cap - Hex](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Extras/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20Cap%20-%20Hex.3mf>)
1. **Option 1:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell Cap - Round](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Extras/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20Cap%20-%20Round.3mf>)

## Extra Outer Shells

1. **Option 1:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell - Hex Holes](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Extras/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20-%20Hex%20Holes.3mf>)
This shell is the same as the standard hex shell, but has chamfered holes
around the LEDs allowing the shell to be printed in any color of TPU.

    * **Pros** 
        * Can be printed with any color TPU
        * Crisp patten display due to lack of diffusion
        * Darker shells look cool, and are less visible in motion
    * **cons**
        * Poor visibility at angles due to lack of difusion
        * LEDs are exposed to dirt and moisture (solvable with clear tape)
        * Slight gaps in pattern if the poi antispin roll while spinning at
          certain speeds
        * Only works for led strips with 20 leds
1. **Option 2:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell - Hex Holes - 55 Pixel](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20-%20Hex%20Holes%20-%2055%20Pixel.3mf>)
This shell is the same as the standard hex holes shell, but it has one big
hole and will work for any number of LEDs. It requires cutting away the
supports included in the model, and can be a bit soft/floppy after removal. I
reccomend angle cutters.
1. **Option 3:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell - Round Superdiffuser](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Extras/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20-%20Round%20SuperDiffuser.3mf>) 
This shell is designed to try and maximize diffusion.

    </div>

    * **Pros** 
        * Looks cool when sitting still
        * Softens overly pixelated patterns
    * **cons**
        * Too much diffusion, makes artwork blurry
        * Extra thick and heavy
        * Really firm/hard due to shape
