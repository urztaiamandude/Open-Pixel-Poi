# Open Pixel Poi - 3D Printed Body

## Main Body
Print all the main body parts in **PLA** or any other rigid material. Slicer
profiles such as layer height an infill are not important, just make sure you
can do the overhangs. The individual body files have been pre-oriented so that
no supports/brims/rafts/etc are required, see the section on orientation below
to confirm your orientation. You need 1 of each part per poi, or 2 of each for
a pair.
###### Main body parts are:
1. [Open Pixel Poi - Body - Top](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Body%20-%20Top.3mf>)
1. [Open Pixel Poi - Body - Bottom](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Body%20-%20Bottom.3mf>)
1. [Open Pixel Poi - Body - Button](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Body%20-%20Button.3mf>)

## Outer Shell
The outer shell must be printed in **Clear / Transparent TPU**. Ive included 3
primary shell variants and a few more in the
[Extras](./3d-printed-extras.md) page. For HD LED strips make sure to use the
ones labeled "55 Pixel" to minimize diffusion. For 20 or 25 pixel led strips,
the regular shells all work.

The round shell should be mostly unaffected by infill, as it has thin walls
and internal cavities to control diffusion. The hex shells look nice in 10%
gyroid or 3d honeycomb. All shell files are preoriented and do not require any
supports/brims/rafts/etc, see the section on orientation below to confirm your
orientation. You need 1 shell per poi, so that means 2 shells for a pair. If
you're undecided which shell you want, go with the round one.

Update: I've started dumping more shell designs in the
[Extras](./3d-printed-extras.md) page, including one with holes for the LEDs
allowing it to be printed in any color TPU. However, the 2 options here are
the best.
###### Shells are:
1. **Option 1:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell - Hex](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20-%20Hex.3mf>)
1. **Option 2:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell - Round Diffused](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20-%20Round%20Diffused.3mf>)
1. **Option 3:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell - Hex - 55 Pixel](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20-%20Hex%20-%2055%20Pixel.3mf>)

## Orientation
The parts all print without supports when oriented like this. Take special
note of orientation the bottom half of the body, the led groove is an
overhang rather than requiring supports.

## All in one file
Alternatively [Open Pixel Poi - All Parts In One File](/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20All%20Parts%20In%20One%20File.3mf)
contains all the parts of a single poi body. You will need to split the
object to seperate out the parts, and orient them on your own.

## Extras
The [Extras](./3d-printed-extras.md) page contains more shell variants, shell
caps, poi knobs, and whatever else seems relevant to upload. Nothing in this
folder is required to have a functional poi, but it is worth having a look.
